How to start the mediation process?
The mediation process is initiated by addressing or referring to a mediator. The mediator will conduct and interview with you in order to assess whether your case is mediable. If it is, the mediator will contact both parties in order to establish a suitable day for the mediation session. Sides will sign mediation agreement. Prior to the session, mediator might request specific information to familiarize him/her self with the case.
